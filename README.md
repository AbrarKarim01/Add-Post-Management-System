User Types:
- There are three distinct user types in our system: super-admin, admin, and regular users.
Admin Post Management:

- Admins should have the capability to create, edit, update, and delete their own posts.
Post Review by Super-Admin:

- Once an admin submits a post, it will undergo a review process by the super-admin.
Post Visibility:

- If the super-admin approves the posts, they will be made visible on the homepage for regular
users.
- If not approved, the posts will remain invisible to users.
- Just work with the data formats, no need to insert images
